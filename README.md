Just got out of the chaos that was Marked Men. Still reeling, head buzzing like I was just on a rollercoaster — not advisable on three hours of sleep, let me tell you that. Sat on this creaky, uncomfortable bench that's probably plotting against my back. Wow, that   was like...I don’t know, like pouring a jar of orange marmalade into a blender with shrapnel — sticky and unexpectedly sharp at the same time. 

> Can’t shake off the glare of the neon EXIT sign that tangled with the intense final scene; it’s like those bright colors followed me out here, stubbornly painting my retinas, refusing to fade. The volume was cranked up to eleven I swear, or was it just the crescendo of my own popcorn-munching madness syncing perfectly with the explosions on scene? Those sequences, my god, seemed endless at times, especially in that dark alley where bullets seemed to have their own grudges. Back's aching. 

Remember how someone asked me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? But I am not sure if the  's chaos would translate well onto a small screen. Some theater magic should just remain enigmatic, sprawling over in surround sound. 

The lead character, what was his name.. something starting with a J, James maybe? Anyways, he was moving through those frantic fight scenes like a cat stuck in a sock, no, a cat in a hurricane! While the villain’s monologue dragged on — the flavor of cardboard again — felt like they were reading aloud terms and conditions.  I could practically hear the popcorn crumbs scraping together like tiny tectonic plates under my seat by then. 

Not sure if I can recommend to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, unless you have a true penchant for chaos with misplaced sentimentality. Go sit at that weird diner down the road, the one with the rude owls, and rethink cinematic choices. There's a charm to it somewhere, you’ll just have to sift through like finding a coin in a kiddy pool full of jellybeans.

I'm gonna go decompress now. It's been one helluva whirlwind.
